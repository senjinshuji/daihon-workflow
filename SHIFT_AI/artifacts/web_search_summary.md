I do not have access to real-time information, including live customer reviews and ratings for specific companies like SHIFT_AI.

To find this information, I recommend you try the following:

* **Look for social media mentions:** Search for SHIFT_AI on platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook.  You might find user comments and discussions there.


**Regarding other aspects of SHIFT_AI (assuming it's an AI company), to get a complete picture, you'll need to research them directly.  However, I can give you a framework for what to look for:**

**Features:**  This will depend heavily on what SHIFT_AI *does*.  Possible features for an AI company could include:

* **Specific AI capabilities:**  Machine learning models, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, etc.

* **Support level:**  Higher levels of support may come at a premium.


**Competitors:**  To identify SHIFT_AI's competitors, you need to know their specific niche within the AI market.  Once you know their area of focus, you can research other companies offering similar solutions.
